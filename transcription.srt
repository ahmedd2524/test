1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,919
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV.

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,720
But where are those good old-fashioned values on which we used to rely?

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,100
Lucky is a family guy.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,500
Lucky is a man who buys what he can do.

5
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,519
All the things that make us laugh and cry.

6
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,519
He's a family guy.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,420
We now return to Vetter Call Saul.

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,259
Hey, Saul.

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,920
Got into a little trouble and I'm gonna need a lawyer.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:42,939
Here.

11
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,380
Okay, so tell me exactly what happened.

12
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,179
I was driving.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Had a bit of drinking, then I ran into a milk truck.

14
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:51,340
Yeah, here.

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,000
Were you on drugs?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,960
Ian blew ho.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,359
Turn that off.

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,700
I'm mad at TV.

19
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:58,880
Peanut, what's wrong?

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,840
Family Guy has been around since 1999 and whenever it's time for the Emmys, they don't give us one.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,560
I'm sick of it.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,019
Well, I'm not making another episode with the Simpsons.

23
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,140
What did that get us?

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,540
I'll tell you what it got us.

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,180
More ink for the Simpsons.

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:11,680
Yeah.

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,879
Simpsons plays down to competition.

28
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,980
Simpsons step into the sewer.

29
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,780
Shame on you, Simpsons.

30
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,280
Those lucky bastards.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,879
Well, this week, we do classy comedy.

32
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:22,879
Emmy comedy.

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,739
I think that's a great idea.

34
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,659
It's about time we made some quality television, like Modern Family, Girls, and Transparent.

35
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:30,799
That's the spirit.

36
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:34,000
Griffins, let's make this our Emmy-winning episode.

37
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,439
So get all your pukes and farts out now.

38
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:44,040
I mean, I mean, I mean, not funny.

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:54,599
Kids, it's me, tu madre.

40
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,879
Lois Griffin.

41
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,000
Time for breakfast.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,040
Oh, yeah.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,680
Come on in, Lois, which is who you are.

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,859
My wife, Lois.

45
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,060
Hugging my wife.

46
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,060
Mm.

47
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,060
Package for Peter Griffin.

48
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,060
Thank you, unknown delivery woman.

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,460
Forget the freaking Emmy.

50
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,060
If you touch her ass, I will.

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,060
Amazon.

52
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,060
My uncle Alejandro lives in the Amazon.

53
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,060
Do you think he has sent us shoes made from banana leaves?

54
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:29,060
Boy, the ethnic characters on these Emmy-winning shows aren't exactly rocket scientists, are they?

55
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,060
I don't know what you're talking about, Liz Lemon.

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,060
No, this is something I ordered.

57
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,060
For me.

58
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,060
I am a woman, and always have been.

59
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,060
I've made plans to undergo surgery so my wang don't get in the way of the woman what I am.

60
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,060
Ay, Dios mio!

61
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,060
Lois, I'll still be a parent to our children.

62
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,060
But now, I'll be a trans-parent.

63
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,060
Get it?

64
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,060
Transparent?

65
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,060
Clever pun, right?

66
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,060
Please honor me for my courage.

67
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:09,060
I think gender reassignment surgery is very brave, and the fat man should win some kind of award for it.

68
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,060
The fat woman.

69
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,060
He hasn't chopped it off yet.

70
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,060
That doesn't matter.

71
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,060
Peter already identifies as a woman.

72
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,060
And on karaoke night, I identify as George Michael.

73
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,060
That doesn't mean it's true.

74
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,060
Brian's just mad because he has to be the lady one.

75
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,060
I'm not a woman, which makes you the one who's gay in real life.

76
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:32,060
Daddies, I'm standing here delivering my line with more emotion and less of a monotone than the actual lily on modern family.

77
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,060
I'm now confident enough to share my truth with the rest of my loved ones, beginning with my son Chris.

78
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,060
Bazinga, Father. Assuming Father is still the appropriate designation.

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,060
What are you doing?

80
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,060
Waiting for the laugh to die down.

81
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,060
I'm here because I've decided to become the woman I am inside. Can you find it in your heart to accept me?

82
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,060
Oh, Dad. Science has moved so far past binary gender construction, and if being a woman makes sense,

83
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,060
and if being a woman makes you happy, then in the words of Mr. Spock, it's only logical.

84
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,060
Wow, I couldn't follow any of that. But look how smart your audience is.

85
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,060
Ha ha!

86
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,060
Louis C.K., is that you?

87
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,060
Yep. I'm a big fan of yours, Peter.

88
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,060
Wow, that's great! Because if Louis C.K. likes something, everyone has to.

89
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,060
That's right.

90
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,060
Well, I'm glad my popularity has cooled off just enough that you were able to get me to do this.

91
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,060
Bye, Peter.

92
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,060
Boy, he's not afraid to go.
